Some Examples would include:
600+ items, many of which are very unique functioning weapons, armor sets, and accessories! From the start all the way to post moonlord
10+ unique bosses, many of which reworked from past versions, as well as rematches/varients
4 unique, unusual town npcs: including a Dragon NPC!
3 Dank shrine structures sporting loot, new enemies, and a powerful sword that only gets better which each one obtained!
3 subworld dimensions for you to explore!
A Custom Currency that is tied to mod progression
Support for Boss Checklist, Yet Another Boss Health Bar, Fargos, and Census
No cringy lore
And many more things you've likely never seen done before!

Check out the #portals-SGAmod to get links to the Forum Page (outdated), the Wiki (somewhat WIP), and the Github (Full changelog) for more info!
You could also google and find the homepage, wiki, and github as well if discord isn't your fancy.
And finally, many parts of content in this mod is (still) placeholder sprites due to a lack of active spriters and my inability to make them from scratch, if your a spriter and like what you see, be sure to contact me and we can work something out!

A few warnings before the changelog:

-I do NOT recommended this mod with other mods that add auto-bridgers/helivators. Atleast using those items.
-This mod has issues reloading/unloading, but will work fine if you restart your game thou, justs a heads up!
-This mod has not been properly tested/optimized for multiplayer, while it supports some MP features, many things are disabled in MP
-There's still alot of placeholder sprites! I don't sprite so please be gentle on that front!


4.000-(10/7/22)--Patch 18: Path of the Passionate

-IDG's SGAmod will not be updating to 1.4 or later in any shape or form until Relogic abandons the game again and TMODLoader is as stable as it is on 1.3 (Currently, key TML features in 1.4 do not work that I use often, such as detours)
-The project has become a solo-endever again that I may work on on and off, I am no longer accepting any feedback on features that were "expected" from me anymore or will make me unhappy.


-Added:

-Harvested Souls, Illusionary Bullet, Flask of Hallucinogenics
-Animated mod icon in menu


--Changed:

-Nurse healing reworked, can no longer instantly heal, instead spawns a healing aura over herself that heals you while inside it over time, the aura can be heavily weakened if the nurse is badly hurt

-Several key progression items now require Harvested Souls

-Draken now only has a 1/10 chance to mention the Doom Harbinger if he's unlocked and not fought yet

-Numismatic Crucible now upgrades itself with progression (hardmode, mechs, plantera, moonlord)
