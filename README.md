-True Moonlight's projectiles hit slightly slower and penetrate less, the movement speed of said projectiles doesn't change, and the weapon charges faster with a quick melee swing speed, Lv3 Slashwave hits less often and homes from a greater distance

-Assassin and Elite Emblem have been reworked as the Omni-Magnet now uses the grab bonus

-Novus, Notchvus, and Dosed arrows have had their homing adjusted

-Starfish Burster's and Starfish Blaster's Starfish projectiles all hit on a target


--Fixed:

-Spider Queen not dropping any Gold

-Accessories that were stackable

-Not really a fix, but updating framework for 1.4, so grenades don't end up doing ranged damage when the update comes

-Being able to Dos enemies in gas who were already combusted

-The F.S.R.G not being able to get crits

-True Moonlight and Surt, the projectiles don't interfer with the melee hits anymore

-Star Burster and Starfish-Burster taking mana when you have no ammo left

-Optimized Homing Arrow code a bit, should lead to better FPS with alot of enemies on screen

-Other smaller bugs


2.11-(2/24/20)-Patch #1b:

This version is the same as below, but I was running into a MariaDB error that kept me from posting, and was debugging it.


2.10-(2/24/20)-Patch #1:

--Changed:

-When Calamity is installed-Doom Harbinger and Surpreme Pinky will automatically force Revengence and Death mode off, this is due to a critical conflict between the mods during these fights

-Enhancing Charm turned out to be alot stronger than it said it was and has been nerfed accordingly

-Normal Difficulty now only gives you 80% of the Expertise when rewarded, while expert mode gives the full amount

-Removed Draken's lines that talk about him being sorry to Val, because he's not anymore

-Reverse Engineering Station's crafting recipe has been changed a bit, as well as a few other items, but nothing pace breaking

-Lined-out some tooltips to shorten them being too long on lower resolutions

-Crafting recipes for the Heart Lantern and Star in a Bottle Pets have been altered

-Added Glow Masks for a quite a few weapons


--Fixed:

-HOPEFULLY fixed the Sword Shrines getting deleted by generation (atleast the annoying ones, like traps)

-Cosmillash and Beam Gun now do variable damage where they didn't do any before

-Fixed soft-locking issues with the Grenadier's Glove and speed-related modifiers (upped value worth a bit more too to make reforging less cheap)

-Fixed Virulent and Mangrove item crafting issues and adjusted them to require Dank Wood (where needed)

-I forgot to mention a weapon the previous version added- the Circuit Breaker Blade, so yeah, whoops, also updating how I do changelogs numbers by also adding dates.

-A possible issue with Massive Bleeding and Gourged setting the buff type to a different buff

-Typoes and a few other things



2.0-(2/22/20)-Caliburn's Gifts:

--A majorish-sorta update for you! 3 Caliburn Alters can now be found on new worlds, they each contain a strong pre-hardmode sword, at a price... But it will be worth it for their true form.

--Added the Dank Shrines-a series of 3 mini dungeons brimmed with traps, but with great rewards for those willing to take the challange, can you find all 3 in your world? (Hint-entry point is near the tops, swords are near the bottom, usually)

--Added the Caliburn Trio and their upgrade: True Caliburn

--Added Onyx Tactical Shotgun, Automatic SMG Rifle, Tesla Staff, Circuit Breaker Blade, and Gatlipillar

--Added the Dank Compass to Draken's shop

--Added Dank Wood, Items, and Armor, you can find what you need in Dank Shrine Chests, and when you run out, you can fish em up in there!

--Added a new (mini)Boss-The Spirit of Caliburn, those swords won't come free, you'll need to prove your mettle first

--Added 2 light pets

--Added Revamped Trap Damage system

--Added Prefixes for trap-related items, as well as releated to throwing items and accessories!

--The Grenadier's Glove and Primordial Skull gained a new a passive ability

--Ice Scepter got an alt fire

--Expertise cap is now 16000 (before was 15000)


--Changed:

-The way the HUD above the player is drawn, it is no longer a player layer, but rather an overlay

-XOP Flamethrower's flames can no longer exist going into water, and die like lava rocks do on touching it

-Enemies who are immune to bleeding are now also immune to Massive Bleeding and Gourged

-Updated the tooltip for Havoc's Fragmented Remains

-Added Treepeater tooltip to mention how fast the projectile is.

-Buffed Acid Scepter (charges up faster)

-Reduced speed of Cosmic Cocktail when thrown by hand, added a tip to the Grenadier's Glove

-Altered some items' crafting recipes

-Buffed Sword of a Thousand Truths, is no longer expert only, is now sold by Draken post-Cratrosity

-Nerfed TPS's boss fight, but made the predicted aim of lasers properly... uh, aim. Also nerfed Cratrosity's attacks.

-Nerfed Flame-Trap Thrower and Heat Beater

-Buffed Super Dart Trap 'gun'

-Buffed Sharkvern-his body segments have 75% DR now

-Buffed F.S.R.G and has been moved a bit later in progression as to not serve as a direct sidegrade to the MegaShark

-Nerfed Space Diver Armor's base defense and set bonus: Taking any amount of damage takes off a small potion of the breath meter in addition, also each pierce gives you -5% damage

-Various changes to crafting recipes, mostly to account for the new items

-The mod name again, because I don't think 'content mod' is really that entricing


--Fixed:

-The Expertise system, it was broken with modded npc types, this will effect your save, and will allow you to get over 15K Expertise now. It was that or your characters get bricked.

-Removed left over debug code on Sword of a Thousand Truths

-A possible crash from hovering over items, maybe

-Murk's treasure bag not dropping the Mudmore

-Fixed FlameTrap Thrower doing stupidly high damage up close

-Super Dart Trap 'gun' not showing crit chance-as it's the only trap-related weapon that can infact, crit.

-Draken talking about Calamity related things while only Boss Checklist is installed, also Draken only talks about a home while he is not homeless

-Murk being marked as beaten in hardmode the first time you kill him

-Netcode related stuff, your javelins shouldn't be desyncing so badly now

-Rebalanced some other things


-Known Bugs

-Netcode not 100% guaranteed to work, I have done some tests here and there to iron out the major issues, but still, problems may arise; be aware.

-FlameTrap Thrower bugs out in Enigma's Etherial; the particles are invisible; this is coming from their side, not mine. As to why I have no idea.

-Dank Shrines can sometimes not grow large enough to have any entrances, also they can generate only the center if they generate inside the temple/dungeon (this has happened, quite alot, thou it's rare and I'll fix it later :/)

-When Caliburn Spirits summon traps, they can possibly break the Sword Alter, now I have added 2 extra blocks on both sides to help buffer this, but it might still happen, so try to not be fighting near the alter in this case.

-Wraiths don't seem to drop the proper materials atm per world



1.02-(2/14/20)-Hot Fix #1:

--Added 'technological' to the beginning of all Sam weapons, this is cosmetic for the time being, but I felt they needed their own special damage text

--Changed the tooltips for all trap weapons that cannot crit: the crit chances doesn't show up

--Removed Hammer Editor, for now

--Fixed a nasty bug that would cause null exception errors when making a new character, whoops!


1.01-(2/13/20)-Changed the mod title to try to make it sound more exciting

1.0-(2/13/20)- Released!

The current active team:

[USER=104197]@IDGCaptainRussia[/USER] (me): Coder and mod owner, and a few miscellaneous sprites

yes, it's literally just me, but I'm fine with this, because:



Anarog/Kuronaki#9669 on discord: Made some sprites for different items, has cool ideas too.



JellyBru#3929 (Donno if he has a forums account likely not), did the epic Wraith Resprites



Maskano#8754 (Donno if he has a forums account likely not), epic resprite guru!



Just DudeSquid#4617 and daimgamer#6490 on discord, did some great (Calamity/"Superior") sprites, Squid also has his own mod called Volcanit, where most of his work can be found, check it out!



--------------------------------------------------------------Contributions--------------------------------------------------------------

Zoomo for his fantastic commissioned work! Did various accessories in them in the mod including their equip sprites


[USER=61456]@PhilBill44[/USER] : Spriter, made the mod icon, suggestions and ideas, and other things (I honestly couldn't have made that icon, love ya) (I miss you very much Phil :( )


[USER=75780]@Mister Creeper[/USER] : Former Havoc team Spriter, currently made alot of items including Stormbreaker's sprite. Left the team over personal reasons. Dev items are left in because I refuse to remove my hard work over his petty reasons.


DeJuiceTD#2055 (Donno if he has a forums account likely not), Several great sprite contribs! Including a few resprites


Freya manibrandr: Whom I had commissioned some paid sprites (oh where that come from?) of some very specific things I wanted to make in the mod, this would include all the Serious Sam weapons, and Draken


Dejsprite#0880 : did some sprites, went missing thou :(


MountainyBear49#0279 : Extremely epic Big Dakka resprite, hail Glory mod in their honor!


[USER=161571]@El3trick_Plays[/USER] : Made some sprites for items that needed them, pretty awesome! Later dropped out of the team without a word and cut all contact with me for seemly no reason, oh well, thanks thou!


[USER=156265]@Lonely Star[/USER] : did one sprite and kinda went missing, has shown very little activity, still credit given where due.


Ajax: Made sprites and alot of cool suggestions.


[USER=55315]@Kooyah[/USER] : Retired and former Havoc team Spriter, and all of sharkvern's sprites, and a good chunk of havoc item and tile sprites. (also includes backlog sprites, and he even made an improved one, awesome!)


[USER=58157]@Iggysaur[/USER] : the Havoc team coder before myself, spriter as well, did most of the code for the ported items from that mod.


[USER=48283]@GabeHasWon[/USER] for making Murk originally.

Vasyanex - formally on the Havoc team, they need their own mention as they are the only people I don't have 100% perms to use content from, but I really don't want Vasyanex's sprites going to waste or AlexusIchimonji's Caliburn sprites, and they were meant for havoc which I have perms to use now anyways.

(AlexusIchimonji's sprites have been resprited, so that's one less issue)



Wicloud#1470 on discord: Made Cirno's wings sprites, Ice Fairy Sprites, and a few other things.



[USER=99212]@qwerty3.14[/USER]  :  Allowing me to use his GlowMask Library from his own mod, on top of being a massive inspiration for alot of the more creative things I've made here.



And [USER=56363]@TheRandomMidget[/USER] for permission to port havoc content (including Murk and... pretty much anything I could fit in).



--------------------------------------------------------------And a thanks to:--------------------------------------------------------------

[USER=2644]@zadum4ivii[/USER] : used and edited your stove code because I'm garbage at making multi-tiles :p



[USER=210]@Kazzymodus[/USER]: Gonna be honest, I don't think most people know that Shockwave shader was yours, but the moment I found out... You get the credit!



[USER=75173]@ark?ight[/USER] + [USER=123064]@direwolf420[/USER] + [USER=37401]@jopojelly[/USER] : you 3 have helped me so much since I started modding, I wouldn't be here without your help!



And lastly: someone who pulled me back to finish what I started, they wish to leave the Terraria scene themselves and wish for their name to not be mentioned, but if your reading this, you know who you are. Thank you.


And now finally, some used code mentions:

Boffin#8216 : Thanks for the Trail Shader and Matrix logic required for it! It's gonna be complete epic with how I plan to use it!

[USER=8638]@Joost8910[/USER] Years ago, I adapted some code from his Gigamesh boss to use in IDGLib, and ironically enough, I did it again in recent times! I still use it to this day and very heavily in SGAmod <3 (To be more specific: his fan projectile code from years ago and adapted, and his movement prediction code of recent times)

[USER=75857]@ThatOneJuicyOrange_[/USER] I donno how much of this you wrote yourself, you always had trouble with code, but the blizzard code was borrowed from EA, you are credited in the version of the mod that features it

[USER=52199]@Zoaklen[/USER], I know your not longer here, but if not for your bare bones sky code, I wouldn't have learned to make custom skies, thank you!

[USER=16350]@blushiemagic[/USER] again, many things, mostly stuff from Bluemagic which have served as a major learning tool for me, but in this case it would be your pureium world gen code, and using a cut down version of your World Reaver code to learn the basis of overlays, thank you!
