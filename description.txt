You could also google and find the homepage, wiki, and github as well if discord isn't your fancy.
And finally, many parts of content in this mod is (still) placeholder sprites due to a lack of active spriters and my inability to make them from scratch, if your a spriter and like what you see, be sure to contact me and we can work something out!

A few warnings before the changelog:

-I do NOT recommended this mod with other mods that add auto-bridgers/helivators. Atleast using those items.
-This mod has issues reloading/unloading, but will work fine if you restart your game thou, justs a heads up!
-This mod has not been properly tested/optimized for multiplayer, while it supports some MP features, many things are disabled in MP
-There's still alot of placeholder sprites! I don't sprite so please be gentle on that front!
