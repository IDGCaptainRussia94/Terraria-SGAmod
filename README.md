# SGAmod
IDGCaptainRussia94's content mod

//Items with place holder sprites and need resprites: Twines of Fate, MVM Upgrade, Jagged Overgrown Spike, Hellion's Crown (Item Sprite ?), Some Buff Icons

//Items that are NOT ok to be resprited: Stormbreaker, Wave Beam, Serpent's Redemption, Creeper's Throw, The trap related weapons for now

Github was moved: previous builds of the mod can be found over here: https://github.com/IDGCaptainRussia94/SGAmod

-Crimson only: Jarate, Jarocket, Jarate Shurikens, Heart Guard, Sanguine Bident, Crimson Catastrophe (can be bypassed with fishing)
-Corruption only: Gas Passer, Wraith Arrows, Dosed Arrows, Corrupted Tome, Cursed Hail, Jagged Spike Buckler (can be bypassed with fishing)

-Ideas: Banners, the Couch, Bannerlord=collection of banners tf2/style things, Tech weapons have an "overclock" mechanic that changes up their gameplay while active and overhaul ideas (maybe?), spider queen can melt normal generated blocks (dirt and so)
Cruciatus (damage over time debuff attack), Charon's Ferry (shadow tenticle mount thing), Spider body mount with legs?, Overwatch (Null Watcher), Torch God's Summon, Orge baseball bat, Fly Gun, Prism Banishee drops and Aurora drops, (More) Power Tools? Yoyo Pickaxes! (final tiers), Hamsterball DCU update and Drill Containment Yoyo Upgrade, SS4 Chainsaw rocket ammo type
Spartan Laser/mining railgun (add mining), Shuricane (shuriken Hurricane!), Binding Vudoo Clothier's Doll Magic, Mana Potion Pet (Blue Gusher), Clothier drop that forces dropped throwing items to attack enemies, Make Enchanted Fury/Seriph Shard a Clothier drop
-Battery tank sentry, allows EC (Electric Charge) to be collected from Energy-storing TE tiles

-Planned design plan: Trap damage overhaul that replies on tiles largely to do most of its damage, an "aura" granted by armors and accessories that allow these tiles to inherit player properities when enemies get hurt, and convert non-player owned trap projectiles into player owned ones that get enhanced
-Tech damage and EC regen will be largely based on forming a tech-mod like base to generate electric charge (EC), storing it inside Tile Entiries, and allowing players to extract it manually or via the Battery tank sentry, moving EC to the player.
As it currently stands, regen is effectively gimped and energizer batteries are the only viable way to effectively recharge it

-Add Hellion Army progress Bar, Vibranium Stuff (including Resonating Crystal Enemy and Seismic Resonator Ore Creator), Aurora Gear and finish Luminous Alter Tile Entity!
-Add Hellion army bar, STILL! (canned)

Todo-Aurora Gear, Finish Vibranium enemies, Seismic Resonantor to create the ore, Add Hellion checkpoints!, Finish Luminious Alter (effects), Money Drain Staff thingy, upgradable drones and solar panels? (Laser orbital strike!)
Battle Hud for L.Wraith to tell HP left and show what armor sets are active
-A resonating material called Vibranium can now be found and made into a powerful new armor set, but only if you can overcome the strong new enemies that guard it!
-WoF yoyo that leeches out HP from enemies into the yoyo, heals the player when it retracts (moonlord upgrade too)
-Concussion (thing) accessory that grants bonus damage based off your knockback VS enemy knockback resistance, or just if enemy is immune to knockback
-Omni-shoot, combine all the one-off ammo types of: Styngers, Stakes, Candycorn, Jack o' Lanterns, Nails, and Starfish into an endgame weapon with swappable forms

-"boring" swords:
-Dank Wood Sword, Machete, Rusted Blade, Claymore (maybe),Mudmore, Mangrove Striker,Thermal Blade, Rubied Blade, Curcuit Breaker Blade (maybe), Sword of a Thousand Truths (hhmhhmmm), Celestial Flare (maybe), Galactic Inferno (yes, throw globels and bat them at enemies on hit?)
-call them Zweihänder ? (Nah lets call am Boring Blades)
-Fix Prismic Banshee features (add laser accel), add Rod of Teleportation Telefragging

The current active team:

[USER=104197]@IDGCaptainRussia[/USER] (me): Coder and mod owner, and a few miscellaneous sprites

yes, it's literally just me, but I'm fine with this, because:



Anarog/Kuronaki#9669 on discord: Made some sprites for different items, has cool ideas too.



JellyBru#3929 (Donno if he has a forums account likely not), did the epic Wraith Resprites



Maskano#8754 (Donno if he has a forums account likely not), epic resprite guru!



Just DudeSquid#4617 and daimgamer#6490 on discord, did some great (Calamity/"Superior") sprites, Squid also has his own mod called Volcanit, where most of his work can be found, check it out!



--------------------------------------------------------------Contributions--------------------------------------------------------------

Zoomo for his fantastic commissioned work! Did various accessories in them in the mod including their equip sprites


[USER=61456]@PhilBill44[/USER] : Spriter, made the mod icon, suggestions and ideas, and other things (I honestly couldn't have made that icon, love ya) (I miss you very much Phil :( )


[USER=75780]@Mister Creeper[/USER] : Former Havoc team Spriter, currently made alot of items including Stormbreaker's sprite. Left the team over personal reasons. Dev items are left in because I refuse to remove my hard work over his petty reasons.


DeJuiceTD#2055 (Donno if he has a forums account likely not), Several great sprite contribs! Including a few resprites


Freya manibrandr: Whom I had commissioned some paid sprites (oh where that come from?) of some very specific things I wanted to make in the mod, this would include all the Serious Sam weapons, and Draken


Dejsprite#0880 : did some sprites, went missing thou :(


MountainyBear49#0279 : Extremely epic Big Dakka resprite, hail Glory mod in their honor!


[USER=161571]@El3trick_Plays[/USER] : Made some sprites for items that needed them, pretty awesome! Later dropped out of the team without a word and cut all contact with me for seemly no reason, oh well, thanks thou!


[USER=156265]@Lonely Star[/USER] : did one sprite and kinda went missing, has shown very little activity, still credit given where due.


Ajax: Made sprites and alot of cool suggestions.


[USER=55315]@Kooyah[/USER] : Retired and former Havoc team Spriter, and all of sharkvern's sprites, and a good chunk of havoc item and tile sprites. (also includes backlog sprites, and he even made an improved one, awesome!)


[USER=58157]@Iggysaur[/USER] : the Havoc team coder before myself, spriter as well, did most of the code for the ported items from that mod.


[USER=48283]@GabeHasWon[/USER] for making Murk originally.

Vasyanex - formally on the Havoc team, they need their own mention as they are the only people I don't have 100% perms to use content from, but I really don't want Vasyanex's sprites going to waste or AlexusIchimonji's Caliburn sprites, and they were meant for havoc which I have perms to use now anyways.

(AlexusIchimonji's sprites have been resprited, so that's one less issue)



Wicloud#1470 on discord: Made Cirno's wings sprites, Ice Fairy Sprites, and a few other things.



[USER=99212]@qwerty3.14[/USER]  :  Allowing me to use his GlowMask Library from his own mod, on top of being a massive inspiration for alot of the more creative things I've made here.



And [USER=56363]@TheRandomMidget[/USER] for permission to port havoc content (including Murk and... pretty much anything I could fit in).



--------------------------------------------------------------And a thanks to:--------------------------------------------------------------

Dsurion123 (https://www.furaffinity.net/user/dsurion123/) for the new icon

DRKV333, while you had no direct involvement, your involvement with me, in helping me code has proved invaluable in the long run, also... Effectively Dredon but you've released mods people can play, lol.

[USER=2644]@zadum4ivii[/USER] : used and edited your stove code because I'm garbage at making multi-tiles :p


[USER=210]@Kazzymodus[/USER]: Gonna be honest, I don't think most people know that Shockwave shader was yours, but the moment I found out... You get the credit!


[USER=75173]@Ðark?ight[/USER] + [USER=123064]@direwolf420[/USER] + [USER=37401]@jopojelly[/USER] : you 3 have helped me so much since I started modding, I wouldn't be here without your help!


And lastly: someone who pulled me back to finish what I started, they wish to leave the Terraria scene themselves and wish for their name to not be mentioned, but if your reading this, you know who you are. Thank you.


And now finally, some used code mentions:

Boffin#8216 : Thanks for the Trail Shader and Matrix logic required for it! It's gonna be complete epic with how I plan to use it!

[USER=8638]@Joost8910[/USER] Years ago, I adapted some code from his Gigamesh boss to use in IDGLib, and ironically enough, I did it again in recent times! I still use it to this day and very heavily in SGAmod <3 (To be more specific: his fan projectile code from years ago and adapted, and his movement prediction code of recent times)

[USER=75857]@ThatOneJuicyOrange_[/USER] I donno how much of this you wrote yourself, you always had trouble with code, but the blizzard code was borrowed from EA, you are credited in the version of the mod that features it

[USER=52199]@Zoaklen[/USER], I know your not longer here, but if not for your bare bones sky code, I wouldn't have learned to make custom skies, thank you!

[USER=16350]@blushiemagic[/USER] again, many things, mostly stuff from Bluemagic which have served as a major learning tool for me, but in this case it would be your pureium world gen code, and using a cut down version of your World Reaver code to learn the basis of overlays, thank you!
