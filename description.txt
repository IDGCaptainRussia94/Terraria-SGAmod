And finally, many parts of content in this mod is (still) placeholder sprites due to a lack of active spriters and my inability to make them from scratch, if your a spriter and like what you see, be sure to contact me and we can work something out!

A few warnings before the changelog:

-I do NOT recommended this mod with other mods that add auto-bridgers/helivators. Atleast using those items.
-This mod has issues reloading/unloading, but will work fine if you restart your game thou, justs a heads up!
-This mod has not been properly tested/optimized for multiplayer, while it supports some MP features, many things are disabled in MP
-There's still alot of placeholder sprites! I don't sprite so please be gentle on that front!
